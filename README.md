# Data-Cleaning-Project-for-Uncleaned-Dataset
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing an unclean dataset containing employee records with inconsistencies and mixed data fields. The dataset includes fields such as names with special characters, dates of birth mixed with email IDs, job types, and departments, all of which are unorganized and inconsistent.

1. Introduction

- Objective: The primary objective of this project is to clean and preprocess an unclean dataset containing various inconsistencies and mixed data fields to ensure high-quality data for further analysis.

2. Dataset Description

- Dataset: The dataset consists of employee records with fields like Name, Date of Birth, Email ID, Job Type, and Department. The data is unclean with mixed fields and special characters.

3. Data Cleaning Steps
   - Step 1: Remove Special Characters
   - Step 2: Separate Dates of Birth from Email IDs
   - Step 3: Split Names into First and Last Names

4. Results
- outcome of the data-cleaning process.
- Cleaned Dataset: The dataset has been cleaned, with special characters removed, fields properly separated, and names split into first and last names. The resulting dataset is now ready for analysis.

5. Importance of Data Cleaning
- why data cleaning is crucial in any data-related project.
  - Data Quality: Clean data ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability of analysis results.
  - Improved Model Performance: Machine learning models perform better with clean data, leading to more accurate predictions.
  - Efficiency: Clean data reduces the time spent on troubleshooting data-related issues during analysis or model training.
  - Insights and Decision-Making: High-quality data leads to more reliable insights, which are essential for informed decision-making.

6. Conclusion
- Next Steps: Further analysis or modeling on the cleaned dataset to derive meaningful insights.
