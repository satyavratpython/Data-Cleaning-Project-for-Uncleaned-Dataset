# Data-Cleaning-Project-for-Uncleaned-Dataset
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing an unclean dataset containing employee records with inconsistencies and mixed data fields. The dataset includes fields such as names with special characters, dates of birth mixed with email IDs, job types, and departments, all of which are unorganized and inconsistent.
